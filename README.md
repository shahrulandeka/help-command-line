<h1>[Mini] Get Help in the Command Line</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab example, I run through how to get help in the Command Line Interface (CLI). I will be using the "man" and "whatis" commands to get information on other commands and how they work. I'll also use the "apropos" command to search the manual page for a command with a specified string.
<br/>
<Br/>
At the end of this lab, I have practical experience in using basic Linux Bash shell commands to: <br/>
- Get a short description of a command, <br/>
- Display the "man" pages of a command, and <br/>
- Find commands based on keywords about their functions.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Bash Shell</b> 
- <b>Oracle VM Virtual Box</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10 Pro</b> (22H2)

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

Launch the utility: <br/>
For this scenario, I'm finding more information about commands that I need to use. <br/>
I also need to discover which command to use to perform a certain task. <br/>
First, I'll explore a few commands I can use in the shell to learn more about other commands. <br/>
Next, I'll find an option i need to add to a command. <br/>
Third, I'll use a command to get a brief description of command so I can identify their differences. <br/>
Finally, I'll identify the command I need to perform a task. <br/>

1. Use the "whatis" command to get a brief description of a command: <br/>
For this example, I typed in "whatis cat" to get a short description of "cat" <br/>

<br />
2. Use the "man" command to get a more general description of a command, and information about each of its options: <br/>

<br />
3. Use the "apropos" command to help you remember the exact command: <br/>
Think of it as a focused search with keywords you provide.
